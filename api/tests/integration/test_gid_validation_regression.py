"""
Regression tests for GID validation in tasks.

This test suite prevents the regression where invalid Spotify GIDs (32-char hex UUIDs)
were being passed to the Spotify API, causing 400 "Invalid base62 id" errors.

Production Error:
    HTTP Error for GET to https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/4e7a5a3185bc404abeaf1c8462586d2f/albums
    returned 400 due to Invalid base62 id

Root Cause:
    Artist.gid field contained 32-character hex UUIDs instead of 22-character Spotify IDs,
    and fetch_all_albums_for_artist task was using artist.gid without validation.

Fix:
    - Database migration 0015_normalize_gids.py converts all hex GIDs to base62 format
    - Added validate_spotify_gid() function for validation
    - Added model clean() validation that rejects non-base62 GIDs
