"""Celery tasks for the Spotify library manager.

This package contains all Celery tasks organized by functionality:
- artist: Artist synchronization and fetching
- playlist: Playlist synchronization
- download: Album and song download operations
- maintenance: Cleanup, retry, and validation tasks
- periodic: Scheduled periodic tasks
- core: Shared utilities and helper functions

All tasks are re-exported here for backwards compatibility.
