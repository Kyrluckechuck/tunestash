# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Quick Start

**This is a Docker-first application. Use Docker Compose for all development work.**

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 20+ and Yarn (for local frontend development only)
- Git

### Setup
1. `cp .env.example .env` - Configure environment
2. `mkdir -p ./config && cp api/settings.yaml.example ./config/settings.yaml`
3. Export Spotify cookies to `./config/youtube_music_cookies.txt`
4. `make dev-container` - Start full development stack
5. Access:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - API: http://localhost:5000/graphql (internal)

## Development Commands

### Primary Development (Docker-based)
- `make dev-container` - **Main development command** - Start full stack (API, Frontend, Worker, Beat, PostgreSQL)
- `make dev-container-update` - Rebuild and restart app containers (keeps Postgres running for speed)
- `make dev-container-down` - Stop all Docker services
- `make dev-container-logs` - Tail logs from all services
- `make dev-container-logs-web` - Tail API server logs only
- `make dev-container-logs-worker` - Tail Celery worker logs only
- `make dev-container-logs-frontend` - Tail frontend dev server logs only

### Alternative Local Development (Advanced)
- `make dev` - Start all services locally (requires local PostgreSQL, Python, Node.js)
- `make dev-api` - Start only the API server locally (requires local Python)
- `make dev-frontend` - Start only the frontend dev server locally (requires local Node.js/Yarn)
- `make dev-worker` - Start only the Celery worker locally (requires local Python)

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- `make test` - Run tests for both API and frontend (local Python/Node required)
- `make test-api` - Run API tests with PostgreSQL test database (local Python required)
- `make test-frontend` - Run frontend tests using Vitest (local Node/Yarn required)
- `make test-api-docker` - Run API tests in Docker container
- `make test-frontend-docker` - Run frontend tests in Docker container

#### Linting Commands
- **`make lint-all`** - **RECOMMENDED: Run ALL linters (API + Frontend) in parallel** - Shows all issues at once for easier fixing
- **`make lint-api`** - Run all API linters in parallel (flake8, black, isort, mypy, bandit, pylint)
- `make lint-frontend` - Run frontend linting using ESLint
- `make format` - Format code for both API and frontend (local tools required)
- `make fix-lint` - Auto-fix linting issues where possible (black, isort, eslint --fix)

### GraphQL Type Generation
- **`make graphql-generate`** - **RECOMMENDED: Generate types from local schema** (fast, no server needed)
- `make graphql-schema-fetch` - Fetch schema from running server and regenerate types (use when backend changes)

### Docker Operations
- `make docker-build` - Build Docker image locally
- `docker compose up --build` - Manual Docker startup
- `docker compose down` - Stop Docker services

### Database Management
- `docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate` - Run migrations in web container
- `docker compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser` - Create superuser in web container
- `make dev-db` - Connect to PostgreSQL database directly

## Architecture Overview

This is a **full-stack music library sync application** (TuneStash) with the following key components:

### Backend Architecture
- **Django/FastAPI Hybrid**: Django ORM for data models, FastAPI for API serving
- **GraphQL API**: Primary API interface using Strawberry GraphQL framework
- **Celery Task Queue**: PostgreSQL-backed async task processing (no Redis required)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Django migrations
- **Configuration**: Dynaconf-based settings loading from `/config/settings.yaml`

### Frontend Architecture
- **React + TypeScript**: Modern React application with strict typing
- **TanStack Router**: File-based routing system
- **Apollo Client**: GraphQL client for API communication
- **Vite**: Build tooling and development server
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework

### Key Service Structure
- **API Services** (`api/src/services/`): Business logic layer (artist, album, song, playlist management)
- **GraphQL Types** (`api/src/graphql_types/`): Type definitions and schema
- **Django Models** (`api/library_manager/models.py`): Database schema and ORM models
- **Task Management**: Celery workers handle music downloads and library sync operations

### Docker Services

**Production Services** (`docker-compose.yml`):
- `web`: FastAPI application server (port 5000, internal only)
- `frontend`: Nginx serving static React build (port 80 → host:5000, proxies `/graphql` to web service)
- `worker`: Celery worker for background tasks
- `beat`: Celery beat scheduler for periodic tasks
- `postgres`: PostgreSQL database (port 5432)

**Development Services** (`docker-compose.override.yml`):
- `web`: FastAPI with hot-reload (port 5000, internal only)
- `frontend-dev`: Vite dev server with HMR (port 3000, exposed to host)
- `worker`: Celery worker with auto-restart on code changes
- `beat`: Celery beat with auto-restart on code changes
- `postgres`: PostgreSQL database (port 5432, exposed for direct access)

**Port Mapping Rationale**:
- **Development uses port 3000** for Vite dev server (required for HMR/hot module replacement)
- **Production uses port 5000** for nginx (serves static files + proxies API requests)
- API is always internal-only on port 5000, accessed via Docker network or nginx proxy

## Configuration Files

### Required Configuration
- `.env` - Docker environment variables
- `./config/settings.yaml` - Application settings (mounted volume)
- `./config/youtube_music_cookies.txt` - YouTube Music cookies (used by spotdl for audio sourcing)
- `docker-compose.override.yml` - Local Docker overrides (auto-created)

### Testing Configuration
- Tests use **PostgreSQL** (production parity) with separate `test_tunestash` database
- Docker tests: Use `make test-api-docker` and `make test-frontend-docker` (no local setup needed)
- Local tests: Use `make test-api` (requires local Python) or `make test-frontend` (requires local Node.js)
- No PYTHONPATH setup needed - pytest handles paths automatically

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New GraphQL Operations

**Quick Workflow (Recommended - No Running Server Needed!)**:
1. Add mutation/query document to `frontend/src/queries/*.graphql`
2. Generate types locally: `make graphql-generate` or `cd frontend && yarn generate:local`
3. Use the generated types in your components
4. **Commit everything**: `git add frontend/src/types/generated/ frontend/src/queries/`

**When Backend Schema Changes**:
1. Make backend changes in `api/src/schema/` (mutation.py, query.py, or subscription.py)
2. Start dev container: `make dev-container`
3. Fetch updated schema: `make graphql-schema-fetch`
4. **Commit schema and types**: `git add frontend/src/types/generated/`

**How It Works**:
- `schema.graphql` is the source of truth (committed to repo)
- Local type generation uses `schema.graphql` (no server needed)
- Only fetch from server when backend schema changes
- Pre-commit hooks validate GraphQL documents against schema

**Commands**:
- `make graphql-generate` - Generate types from local schema (fast, no server needed)
- `make graphql-schema-fetch` - Fetch schema from running server and regenerate types
- `cd frontend && yarn generate:local` - Same as `make graphql-generate`
- `cd frontend && yarn schema:fetch` - Fetch schema from server (requires GRAPHQL_CODEGEN_ENDPOINT)

**Important**: GraphQL types are committed to avoid circular dependency during builds. The local schema file eliminates the need for a running server during development.

### Database Changes
1. Modify models in `api/library_manager/models.py`
2. Create migration: `docker compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations`
3. Apply migration: `docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate`
4. Update any affected GraphQL types (see GraphQL Operations section)

### Adding Background Tasks
1. Create task function in `api/library_manager/tasks.py`
2. Decorate with `@shared_task` (from `celery import shared_task`)
3. Queue via `task_name.delay(args)` - **never call directly!**
4. Monitor via the Tasks page in the UI or Django admin

## Code Style & Quality Standards

### Python Standards
- **Black** formatting (88 character line length)
- **isort** for import organization
- **mypy** for type checking with strict settings
- **flake8** for linting
- **bandit** for security analysis
- **pylint** for code quality

### TypeScript/React Standards
- **ESLint** with TypeScript parser
- **Prettier** for consistent formatting
- **Strict TypeScript** configuration
- **React 18** with modern hooks patterns

### Testing Standards
- **pytest** for Python testing with coverage reporting
- **Vitest** for frontend testing
- **Coverage targets**: 80%+ for critical paths

### Comment Standards
- **Never write changelog-style comments** - Comments should explain *why* code exists, not *what changed*
- **Bad**: `# Reduced from 3 to 2 to lower API pressure` or `# Previously used X, now using Y`
- **Good**: `# Limited to 2 concurrent workers to stay within API rate limits`
- **Remove dead code** - Don't comment out code with explanations like `# Removed for X migration`
- If the code's purpose isn't obvious, explain the *reasoning*, not the *history*

### Linting Workflow

**For Claude Code users:** Use `make lint-all` when fixing linting issues. This runs all linters (API + Frontend) in parallel and shows all issues at once, rather than stopping at the first failure.

**What each linter checks:**
- **flake8**: PEP 8 style violations, unused imports, complexity
- **black**: Code formatting (88 char line length)
- **isort**: Import statement ordering
- **mypy**: Type annotations and type safety
- **bandit**: Security vulnerabilities (generates report in `reports/`)
- **pylint**: Code quality, potential bugs, code smells

**Auto-fixing:** Use `make fix-lint` to automatically fix formatting issues (black, isort, eslint --fix).

## Important Development Patterns

### Task Management
- Background tasks use **Celery with PostgreSQL broker** (no Redis needed)
- Task status tracking via `TaskHistory` model
- Long-running operations (downloads, syncing) are queued
- Use `@shared_task(bind=True)` decorator for async operations
- Task monitoring via Django admin or task status endpoints

#### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Celery Task Calling Pattern

**ALWAYS use `.delay()` or `.apply_async()` when calling Celery tasks!**

This is a recurring bug pattern. Celery tasks defined with `@shared_task` MUST be queued, not called directly.

```python
# ❌ WRONG - Calls task synchronously, bypasses queue, causes errors
from library_manager.tasks import fetch_all_albums_for_artist
fetch_all_albums_for_artist(artist_id)  # TypeError: got an unexpected keyword argument 'delay'

# ✅ CORRECT - Queues task for async execution
from library_manager.tasks import fetch_all_albums_for_artist
fetch_all_albums_for_artist.delay(artist_id)  # Properly queued
```

**How to identify Celery tasks:**
1. Defined in `api/library_manager/tasks.py`
2. Decorated with `@shared_task` or `@app.task`
3. Function names in `tasks.py` are tasks - always use `.delay()`

**Common locations to check:**
- `api/library_manager/helpers.py` - All task calls MUST use `.delay()`
- Any mutation in `api/src/schema/mutation.py` calling tasks
- Any service calling background operations

#### Periodic Tasks (Celery Beat Schedule)

The following tasks run automatically via Celery Beat (`api/celery_beat_schedule.py`):

| Task | Schedule | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `sync-all-playlists` | Every 8 hours | Syncs all tracked playlists to detect new songs |
| `validate-undownloaded-songs` | Every 12 hours | Validates songs marked as undownloaded |
| `retry-failed-songs` | Mon/Wed/Fri at 4 AM | Retries downloading songs that failed previously |
| `queue-missing-albums-for-tracked-artists` | Hourly | Queues downloads for new albums from tracked artists |
| `cleanup-celery-history` | Daily (6 AM) | Removes old task history records (older than 30 days) |
| `cleanup-stale-tasks` | Every 5 minutes | Marks stuck/stale tasks as failed |
| `memory-health-check` | Every 10 minutes | Monitors worker memory usage |

**Note**: Celery Beat uses `DatabaseScheduler` which stores schedules in PostgreSQL. To manage schedules:
- **Docker mode**: Use Django shell: `docker compose exec web python manage.py shell`
- **Local mode**: Django Admin at http://localhost:5000/admin/django_celery_beat/
- **Alternative**: Edit schedules directly in `api/celery_beat_schedule.py`

#### One-Off Tasks

For maintenance tasks that need to be triggered manually (not on a schedule), use the One-Off Tasks system:

- **Service**: `api/src/services/one_off_task.py` - Register new tasks in `_register_tasks()`
- **UI**: Tasks page has a "One-Off Tasks" section with "Run Now" buttons
- **GraphQL**: `oneOffTasks` query and `runOneOffTask` mutation

To add a new one-off task:
1. Create the Celery task in `api/library_manager/tasks.py`
2. Register it in `OneOffTaskService._register_tasks()` with id, name, description, and category

### Async/Sync Boundaries - CRITICAL PATTERN

**IMPORTANT**: This codebase mixes async (FastAPI/Strawberry GraphQL) and sync (Django ORM/Celery) code. You must respect async/sync boundaries.

#### Common Pitfalls and Solutions

1. **Celery Task Calls from Async Context**
   ```python
   # ❌ WRONG - Celery .delay() is sync-only
   async def my_service_method():
       my_task.delay(arg)  # Raises: "You cannot call this from an async context"

   # ✅ CORRECT - Wrap in sync_to_async
   from asgiref.sync import sync_to_async

   async def my_service_method():
       def queue_task():
           my_task.delay(arg)

       await sync_to_async(queue_task)()
   ```

2. **Django ORM from Async Context**
   ```python
   # ❌ WRONG - Django ORM calls are sync
   async def my_service_method():
       album = Album.objects.get(id=1)  # Raises sync_to_async error

   # ✅ CORRECT - Wrap ORM calls
   async def my_service_method():
       album = await sync_to_async(Album.objects.get)(id=1)
       # Or for complex operations:
       def get_album():
           return Album.objects.get(id=1)
       album = await sync_to_async(get_album)()
   ```

3. **Model Methods from Async Context**
   ```python
   # ❌ WRONG - Model save() is sync
   async def my_service_method():
       album.wanted = True
       album.save()  # Raises sync_to_async error

   # ✅ CORRECT - Wrap model methods
   async def my_service_method():
       album.wanted = True
       await sync_to_async(album.save)()
   ```

4. **Lazy-Loading Related Objects**
   ```python
   # ❌ WRONG - Accessing related objects can trigger lazy DB queries
   async def my_service_method():
       album = await sync_to_async(Album.objects.get)(id=1)
       return convert_to_type(album)  # album.artist.name triggers lazy load!

   # ✅ CORRECT - Wrap conversion that accesses relations
   async def my_service_method():
       album = await sync_to_async(Album.objects.get)(id=1)
       return await sync_to_async(convert_to_type)(album)

   # ✅ BETTER - Use select_related to prefetch
   async def my_service_method():
       album = await sync_to_async(
           lambda: Album.objects.select_related("artist").get(id=1)
       )()
       return await sync_to_async(convert_to_type)(album)
   ```

#### When to Use sync_to_async

Use `sync_to_async` whenever calling from async context (GraphQL resolvers, async services):
- **Celery task queuing**: `.delay()` or `.apply_async()`
- **Django ORM queries**: `Model.objects.get()`, `.filter()`, `.create()`, etc.
- **Model methods**: `.save()`, `.delete()`, custom model methods
- **Django transactions**: `transaction.atomic()`
- **Any synchronous library calls**

#### Reference Implementations
See `api/src/services/album.py` for examples:
- `AlbumService.download_album()` - Celery task queuing from async using `sync_to_async`
- `AlbumService.get_by_id()` - ORM queries from async context
- `AlbumService.set_wanted()` - Model save operations from async
- `AlbumService._to_graphql_type()` - Converting Django models with lazy-loading protection

### GraphQL Schema
- Auto-generated from Django models using Strawberry
- Type-safe resolvers in `api/src/schema/` (mutation.py, query.py, subscription.py)
- Frontend types generated via GraphQL Code Generator

### Configuration Management
- Settings cascade: `/config/settings.yaml` → environment variables → defaults
- Use `dynaconf` for dynamic configuration loading
- Database credentials and secrets via environment variables
- STORAGES configuration (not deprecated DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE)

### Database Operations
- Use Django ORM exclusively for database access
- Database IDs preferred over GIDs for internal operations
- Migrations: `docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate`
- PostgreSQL-specific features used in production
- Tests use separate PostgreSQL database for production parity

## Development Environment Notes

### Docker vs Local Development
- **Recommended**: Use Docker containers for all development (`make dev-container`)
- **Local tools needed**: Node.js/Yarn for frontend type generation and testing
- **Database operations**: Always use `docker compose exec web` for Django management commands
- **Code quality**: Linting/formatting requires local Python and Node.js tools

### Key Container Commands
- `docker compose exec web python manage.py <command>` - Run Django commands in web container
- `docker compose exec web bash` - Shell into web container
- `docker compose logs -f <service>` - View logs for specific service

### Code Quality & Linting
- **Local linting is available and preferred** - Run linting locally instead of in containers when possible:
  - Python (from `/api` directory): `python3 -m flake8 <file>`, `python3 -m black <file>`, `python3 -m isort <file>`
  - Frontend: Use `yarn lint`, `yarn format`, etc. from `/frontend` directory
- Container-based linting is also available but local is faster and more reliable
- In future you can use the existing cleanup tasks that are used by the CI to perform "easy" fixes for python such as flake8 black and isort, and similarly there are some for yarn/javascript

### CI/CD and Docker Build Caching

The CI workflow uses `docker/build-push-action` with GitHub Actions cache for fast Docker builds:

**How it works:**
- Uses `type=gha` cache backend with separate scopes for backend/frontend
- BuildKit caches Docker layers including yarn and pip installations
- Multi-platform builds (amd64, arm64) are cached per-scope
- First build: ~10-15 minutes, cached builds: ~2-3 minutes

**Local development caching:**
- Dockerfiles use BuildKit cache mounts for yarn and pip
- Cache survives `docker system prune` (BuildKit cache, not image layers)

## Debugging Worker Issues

The application includes diagnostic logging for worker crashes and performance issues. Signal handlers always log SIGTERM events (crashes), while verbose diagnostics can be enabled in `config/settings.yaml`:

```yaml
worker_diagnostics_enabled: true  # Enable for dev/debugging, false for production
```

**Docker Memory Limits** (`docker-compose.yml`):
- Worker: 2GB hard limit (downloads are memory-intensive)
- Web: 1GB hard limit
- Beat: 512MB hard limit

For detailed debugging instructions, crash analysis, and troubleshooting guides, see **[DEBUGGING.md](docs/DEBUGGING.md)**.

## Frontend React Patterns

### Apollo Client Cache keyArgs - CRITICAL

When adding new filter/query parameters to GraphQL queries, you **MUST** add them to the `keyArgs` array in `frontend/src/apolloClient.ts`. Without this, Apollo will return cached results from queries with different filter values.

**Example bug**: Adding `hasUndownloaded` filter to artists query but forgetting to add it to `keyArgs` caused filtered queries to return unfiltered cached results.

```typescript
// frontend/src/apolloClient.ts
artists: {
  keyArgs: [
    'isTracked',
    'hasUndownloaded',  // ← MUST add new filter params here
    'search',
    'sortBy',
    'sortDirection',
  ],
  // ...
}
```

**How keyArgs works**: Apollo uses these fields to generate unique cache keys. Queries with different values for `keyArgs` fields are cached separately. Fields NOT in `keyArgs` (like `first`, `after` for pagination) share the same cache entry.

**When adding a new query parameter**:
1. Add it to the GraphQL schema and query
2. Add it to `keyArgs` in `apolloClient.ts`
3. Test by toggling the filter and verifying the UI updates correctly

### Function Props in Effects - Use Ref Pattern
When a component receives a function prop that will be called inside a `useEffect`, ALWAYS use the ref pattern to avoid requiring the parent to memoize. This makes components robust and defensive.

**Reference implementations**:
- `frontend/src/hooks/useDebouncedSearch.ts` (lines 11-32)
- `frontend/src/components/ui/SearchInput.tsx` (lines 20-35)

**Pattern**: Store function in ref, update ref in separate effect, main effect uses `ref.current` and does NOT include the function in dependencies.

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
- Local testing needs to test port 3000, always
- Do not kill my servers -- I leave them running on purpose. Only restart/update them when the changes actually require it, and don't shut them down when you're done unless I ask. If you have a good reason to do it, you can ask first.
- Do not add comments that explain *what* the code does when the code is self-explanatory. Only add comments when they provide genuine value for future readers (e.g., explaining *why* something non-obvious is done, documenting gotchas, or clarifying complex business logic).
